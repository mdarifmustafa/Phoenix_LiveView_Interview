  "answers": {
    "1": "Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows separation of cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic, enabling cleaner code structure.",
    "2": "Spring Boot supports AOP through the Spring AOP module, which provides features for defining aspects, pointcuts, and advice.",
    "3": "@Aspect is an annotation used to indicate that a class contains advice and pointcut definitions.",
    "4": "A pointcut is an expression that matches join points, defining where advice should be applied in the application.",
    "5": "Pointcut expressions can be defined using AspectJ expression syntax, specifying method names, parameters, and other criteria.",
    "6": "A pointcut defines where advice can be applied, while advice is the action taken at those join points.",
    "7": "@Before advice runs before the execution of a matched method, allowing you to execute code prior to the target method.",
    "8": "@AfterReturning advice runs after a method has executed successfully, allowing you to process the returned value.",
    "9": "@AfterThrowing advice handles exceptions thrown by a method, allowing for custom error handling logic.",
    "10": "@Around advice wraps the method execution, allowing you to execute code both before and after the method call, and even modify the returned value.",
    "11": "Logging with AOP can be handled by creating aspects that define pointcuts for logging method execution and results.",
    "12": "JoinPoint provides information about the current method execution, such as method name, parameters, and target object.",
    "13": "ProceedingJoinPoint is a specialized JoinPoint that allows you to control the execution of the method and access its arguments.",
    "14": "@EnableAspectJAutoProxy enables support for handling components marked with @Aspect, allowing Spring to create proxies for them.",
    "15": "Use cases of AOP include logging, performance monitoring, security checks, and transaction management.",
    "16": "AOP helps implement cross-cutting concerns by allowing developers to define reusable aspects that can be applied across multiple methods.",
