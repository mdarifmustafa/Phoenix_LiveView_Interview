  "answers": {
    "1": "Java 9 introduced features like the module system (JPMS), jshell, factory methods for collections, enhancements to Stream API, HTTP/2 Client API, and more.",
    "2": "JPMS is a module system that helps in better structuring Java applications by grouping classes into modules.",
    "3": "The module system improves application architecture by allowing modular development, providing better encapsulation, and reducing the application size.",
    "4": "A module descriptor (module-info.java) defines a module in Java 9, listing its dependencies and exported packages.",
    "5": "You define a module using the 'module' keyword in the module-info.java file, specifying requires, exports, and opens.",
    "6": "'requires' specifies module dependencies, 'exports' makes packages accessible to other modules, and 'opens' allows reflection.",
    "7": "Java 9 maintains backward compatibility through unnamed modules, which are used for JAR files without a module descriptor.",
    "8": "Transitive dependencies allow a module to pass on its dependencies to other modules that depend on it.",
    "9": "Automatic modules allow legacy JAR files to be treated as modules without a module-info.java file.",
    "10": "jshell is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool introduced in Java 9 for testing and executing Java code snippets.",
    "11": "jshell provides an interactive environment for quick testing and debugging without needing to write a full Java program.",
    "12": "Factory methods for collections provide concise ways to create immutable List, Set, and Map collections using List.of(), Set.of(), and Map.of().",
    "13": "You create immutable collections using List.of(), Set.of(), and Map.of() by passing elements directly to these methods.",
    "14": "The new Process API in Java 9 allows better control and management of operating system processes.",
    "15": "You manage processes using the ProcessHandle class and its methods like info(), children(), and destroy().",
    "16": "Enhancements to the Stream API include new methods like takeWhile(), dropWhile(), and ofNullable().",
    "17": "takeWhile() returns a stream containing elements until the condition is met, and stops further processing.",
    "18": "dropWhile() drops elements until the condition is met and processes the remaining elements in the stream.",
    "19": "ofNullable() creates a stream with a single element or an empty stream if the element is null.",
    "20": "The iterate() method allows you to create an infinite stream with an initial value and a function to generate subsequent elements.",
    "21": "Optional.ifPresentOrElse() allows you to handle the presence of a value or perform an alternative action if it's absent.",
    "22": "Optional.stream() converts an Optional into a stream, making it easier to integrate with the Stream API.",
    "23": "Java 9's CompletableFuture API introduces new methods like newIncompleteFuture(), minimalCompletionStage(), and copy().",
    "24": "The Flow API is part of the reactive programming paradigm, providing Publisher, Subscriber, Subscription, and Processor interfaces.",
    "25": "You implement reactive programming using the Flow API by defining publishers and subscribers for asynchronous data streams.",
    "26": "The @Deprecated annotation now has the forRemoval and since attributes to indicate future removal and version introduction.",
    "27": "The ProcessHandle interface provides a handle to the native process and methods to retrieve process details like PID, start time, CPU usage, and parent process.",
    "28": "Private interface methods allow default and static methods to share code by defining private helper methods within the interface.",
    "29": "Multi-Release JAR Files allow you to create JAR files that can contain different class files for different Java versions, ensuring backward compatibility.",
    "30": "In Java 9, the try-with-resources statement allows you to use existing resources that are final or effectively final, without explicitly declaring new variables.",
    "31": "Java 9 introduces improvements to String, including a more memory-efficient internal representation using byte arrays (Compact Strings).",
    "32": "Compact Strings in Java 9 optimize memory by storing Strings as byte arrays (if the string contains only Latin-1 characters) instead of char arrays.",
    "33": "The Stack-Walking API provides an efficient and flexible way to traverse the call stack, offering more control over stack walking than the traditional Throwable.getStackTrace().",
    "34": "The VarHandles API provides a more flexible and safer alternative to the sun.misc.Unsafe class, allowing low-level operations on variables.",
    "35": "VarHandles are safer and more flexible than Unsafe because they provide access control and support volatile, atomic, and ordered operations, unlike Unsafe.",
    "36": "Java 9 improves garbage collection by making the G1 Garbage Collector the default and enhancing its performance for low-latency applications.",
    "37": "The G1 Garbage Collector focuses on minimizing pause times and improving overall application throughput by organizing heap memory into regions.",
    "38": "The Unified Logging feature in Java 9 provides a common logging framework for all JVM components, making it easier to manage and filter logs.",
    "39": "Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation allows you to compile Java bytecode into native code before runtime, improving startup time and performance.",

    "41": "jlink is a new tool in Java 9 that allows you to create custom runtime images, optimizing application size by including only the necessary modules.",
    "42": "jlink optimizes application size by generating a reduced runtime that includes only the modules required by your application.",
    "43": "Java 9 includes enhancements to the Security Manager, improving sandboxing by restricting operations based on modules and their access levels.",
    "44": "The StackWalker API provides a more performant and flexible way to access and traverse stack frames compared to the traditional Throwable.getStackTrace() method.",
    "45": "Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS) allows multiple Java applications to share common class metadata, reducing startup time and memory footprint.",
    "46": "The Memory Layout API in Java 9 provides low-level access to memory segments and layouts, which is useful for working with native code.",
